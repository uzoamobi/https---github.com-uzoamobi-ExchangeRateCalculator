Gabriel's Exchange Rate Calculator

I used the Fetch API to make an HTTP request to a third party API to get some exchange rates and then put
that into the DOM.



THe third party API: from https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ 
this free third party API will allow me to hit this endpoint htps:..   to the set currency that i choose 
so that when a request is made and response is gotten back then it is inserted into the DOM.



In the future I plan to: 
Add crypto exchange features
Financial market news 
Live exhcange rate banner
